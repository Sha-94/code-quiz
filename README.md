## Description
The code quiz is a vanilla javascript web app that provides an assessment for students learning JavaScript. To begin the quiz, users should click the 'Start Quiz' button on the main page.
Once the assessment has begun, a timer will start to countdown from 75 seconds and series of questions will appear on the screen. When the user selects an answer choice, they will be prompted with a new 
question. If the previous answer was wrong, they will be penalized and 10 seconds will be removed from the clock. At the end of the assessment, the user will be presented with their results, that contain a score 
of the time they had left and a text field to enter their initials. When submit is clicked the user will be presented with the top 3 highest scores where they have the option to clear the learderboards or go back to the start page.
